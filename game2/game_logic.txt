Steps
    1. Create the repository (ok)
    2. Study the request (What & Why?)
       2.1 Ask the player if they want to start a game
       2.2 if “yes” start game with 2 cards for the player and computer
        2.2.1 If click on 'draw a card', give one extra card and check
        2.2.2 If click on 'stand' end players turn. -> player-display (div id) 'it's the computers turn' 
       2.3 check (function) the values for the player
	      2.3.1 if Value <  21, player-display (div id) “please draw a card or stand?”
	      2.3.2 Value = 21 output (div id) 'you won' + end game + restart game + player display (div id) 'do you want to play again?'
	      2.3.3 Value > 21 output (div id) “busted!” + end game + restart game + player display (div id) 'do you want to play again?'
	   2.4 Computer starts the game with two cards (we use the check function with different parameters)
	     2.4.1 if Value <  21, computer continues the game
	     2.4.2 if value < 21 and/or >= 15 the computer stops all together -> if value is smaller 21 and greater or 
         equal 
         21 < value >= 15 the computer stops all together -> if value is smaller 21 and greater or 
         equal 
         to 15, the computer stops (= safe area)
	     2.4.3 Value = 21, output (div id) “computer won” + end game + restart game
	     2.4.4 Value > 21 output (div id) “computer is busted, you won!” + end game
       2.5 
    3. Identify technical challenges (How?)
    4. Identify design challenges (How?)
    5. Plan the work, divide it in macro tasks (don't forget a little design), and each macro task 
    in sub-tasks
    6. Divide the tasks in the group and between the pairs, and start coding!

Welcome to the one and only casino in Vanillaville
[Casino_Vanilla](https://balderb.github.io/Casino_Vanilla/index.html). 


## What?

Here at Vanillaville we take pride with our first and only casino! With this casino, we expect to see an increase on toursism to our humble town. But the _GRAND_ opening has been delayed because of some unexpected circumstances. Who would have guessed that *PAPER* was *THAT* important?

Anywho, lets not get stuck on the delayed Grand Opening and see on what is happening now. With the help of four skilled, but unnamed coders, Casino_Vanilla will be able to open up their doors in a virtual manner! :grin:
##### Yes! You heard that right!
The first ever casino in Vanillaville will be a fancy _Virtual Casino_. :computer:

## Why?

It has been the dream of a young enterprise since the beggining of its short life.

## How?

The four skilled coders will have to defeat the difficult task of designing something a website that is easy for everyone to understand.
Will they apply good and consistent design throughout all the website? <br>
Will they bring more than two games to the website? <br>
Will they add some wacky new features we have not seen before? <br>
Stay tuned for further development!

## Who?

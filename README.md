# Casino_Vanilla

Welcome to the one and only casino in Vanillaville, the only town where the collective favorite ice-cream flavour is _"Pineapple"_


## What?

Here at Vanillaville we take pride with our first and only casino. The _grand_ opening has been delayed because of some unexpected circumstances. Who would have guessed that *paper* was *that* important? 

Anywho, lets not wallow on the delayed Grand Opening and see on what is happening now. With the help of four skilled but unnamed coders,  Casino_Vanilla will be able to open up their doors in a virtual manner! 
##### Yes! You heard that right! 
The first ever casino in Vanillaville will be a fancy _Virtual Casino_. Look out Silicone Valley, we are coming after you! 

## Why?

It has been the dream of a young enterprise since the beggining of its short life. It always brings a tear to my eyes to see the dream of a small enterprise reach its dreams.

## How?

The four skilled coders will have to defeate the difficult task of designing something a website that is easy for everyone to understand, from sweet old Oma with arthritis, to short-attention-span, tik-tok generation. 
Will they apply good and consistent design throughout all the website? 
Will they bring more than two games to the website? 
Will they add some wacky new features we have not seen before? 
Stay tuned for further development!

## Who?

Top recent news! A hacker found out the names of the skilled coders that where brave enought to tackle such an incredible task! Their names are;
Lisa Baetsle, Karolina Dys, Balder Bongaerts and Alejandro Jose Perdomo Cuello Polania Noguera (that last one sure is a mouthfull!)

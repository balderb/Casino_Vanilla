# Casino_Vanilla :slot-machine:

Welcome to the one and only casino in Vanillaville, the only town where the collective favorite ice-cream flavour is _"Pineapple"_ :pineapple:


## What?

Here at Vanillaville we take pride with our first and only casino! :sunglasses: With this casino, we expect to see an increase on toursism to our humble town. But the _GRAND_ opening has been delayed because of some unexpected circumstances. :sob: Who would have guessed that *PAPER* was *THAT* important? :confused:

Anywho, lets not get stuck on the delayed Grand Opening and see on what is happening now. With the help of four skilled, but unnamed coders,:open_mouth: :busts_in_silhouette:  Casino_Vanilla will be able to open up their doors in a virtual manner! :grin:
##### Yes! You heard that right! :tada:
The first ever casino in Vanillaville will be a fancy _Virtual Casino_. :computer: Look out Silicone Valley, we are coming after you! :watch:

## Why?

It has been the dream of a young enterprise since the beggining of its short life. :moneybag: It always brings tears to my eyes to see the dream of a small enterprise reach its dreams. :cry:

## How?

The four skilled coders will have to defeate the difficult task of designing something a website that is easy for everyone to understand, from sweet old _oma_ with arthritis, :older_woman: :phone: to short-attention-span, tik-tok generation _youngsters_ :baby: :iphone: <br>
Will they apply good and consistent design throughout all the website? :see_no_evil: <br>
Will they bring more than two games to the website? :hear_no_evil:<br>
Will they add some wacky new features we have not seen before? :speak_no_evil: <br>
Stay tuned for further development! :computer:
